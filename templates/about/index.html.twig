        <p>
            This website was created to automatically collect and display various data
            from the world of <a href="https://www.nexusclash.com/" rel="external">Nexus Clash</a> game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently the only implemented feature is a "time machine" that presents various Leaderboards
            in their state at the end of Breath 3.5.

        <p>This webpage is still just an early prototype and there is no official, user-friendly way to submit data.</p>
        <p>If you really want to use the same experimental procedure that I used, please contact me for details.</p>

        <h1>Open source</h1>
        <p>
            Source code is primarily hosted on

            but for convenience and redundancy it is also mirrored to a few popular code hosting portals:

        <h1>Bugs and patches</h1>
        <p>
            If you want to report a bug or submit a code patch, I would prefer if you used one of the above-mentioned
